            This website is not an official KPU website and although the numbers are automatically crawled from pilpres2014.kpu.go.id you should not treat this as official numbers.

            DA1 data that is sent from the District is a result that has been decided on its level and not at the national level and not the final results because the data may change according
            to the results of a plenary meeting on the level above or at the level of the central plenum.

            The motivation for this website is to make the #pilpres2014 data available to public as quick as possible with the widest possible reach and so that the world can be the Watchdogs
            for an honest, clean, respectable and integral democracy process.

            The data is obtained by automatic crawling http://pilpres2014.kpu.go.id periodically and updated every 2 hours automatically.
            <br/>
            There is no public API published by KPU.go.id but I have reversed-engineered the API and it is documented <a href="https://github.com/ht4n/Pilpres2014/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.

            With years of experience and background of administering tens of thousands machines in data-center we have learned 
            that the only best way to run a system is to build a simple and robust architecture and automate everything to minimize
            any errors due to manual human process. Most importantly we all need to sleep and let the site running 24/7.<br/>
            The pilpres2014 pipeline has been running fully under 'autopilot' mode with 0 administrator.<br/><br/>
            We use a simple Windows task scheduler and batch-scripts to execute the following work flow automatically:<br /><br />
                1. Triggers crawling task and run data processing and formatting<br/>
                2. Commit and push the metadata and reports to GitHub<br/>
                3. Windows Azure will auto-pull the changes to http://www.pilpres2014.org<br/>

            The 1-pager system architecture can be viewed <a href="Resources/pilpres2014_architecture.pdf">here</a>
